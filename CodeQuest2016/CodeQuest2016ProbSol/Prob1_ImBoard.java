 * Prob1_ImBoard 
 * 
 * Are you tired of traditional game boards like checker boards or chess
 * boards?  Us too!  We would like to invent a game that is played on a
 * board where every square is the same, and we need your help to 
 * construct the game board. Youâ€™ll need to write a program to help you,
 * of course.
 * 
 * Write a program which displays an N x N square board made using the 
 * pound sign (#). For example N=5 would produce:
 * 
 * # # # # #
 * # # # # #
 * # # # # #
 * # # # # #
 * # # # # #
 * 
 * Program Input: The first line of the file Prob01.in.txt will contain
 * a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  
 * Each test case will have the following input: A single integer N
 * 
 * Example Input: 2  5  3
 * 
 * Program Output: For each test case, your program should print 
 * "Game Board Size: N x N". Your program should output the 
 * N x N board putting spaces between your pound signs, but not 
 * at the beginning or end of the line.  
 * 
 * Example Output:
 * 
 * Game Board Size: 3 x 3
